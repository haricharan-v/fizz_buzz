# FizzBuzz Python Script

## Description
This Python script implements the classic FizzBuzz problem. It takes an integer `n` as input and generates a list of strings based on the following rules:
- If a number is divisible by 3, replace it with "Fizz."
- If a number is divisible by 5, replace it with "Buzz."
- If a number is divisible by both 3 and 5, replace it with "FizzBuzz."
- Otherwise, keep the number as is.

## How to Use
1. Run the script.
2. Enter an integer when prompted.
3. The script will generate a list of strings based on the FizzBuzz rules up to the entered number.
4. The result will be printed.

## Function

### `fizzbuzz(n: int) -> List[str]`
   - **Input:** 
     - `n`: An integer representing the range of numbers to apply the FizzBuzz rules.
   - **Output:** 
     - Returns a list of strings based on the FizzBuzz rules.

## Example
### Sample Input
```
Enter a number: 15
```

### Sample Output
```
['1', '2', 'Fizz', '4', 'Buzz', 'Fizz', '7', '8', 'Fizz', 'Buzz', '11', 'Fizz', '13', '14', 'FizzBuzz']
```

## Note
Feel free to use and modify the script as needed for your applications.
